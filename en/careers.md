# A Career at Theeta

Work at Theeta is fast-paced and partially self-directed. We welcome open minds, people who want agency over their work and reward initiative.

We know you can’t know everything on your first day and take our time showing you the ropes and sharing our personal tips.

Our founders have a proven track record of leading successful businesses. We’re going to be around for a long time and you can grow with us.


## Open Roles

We are not currently actively hiring, but if you believe you’d be a great fit, send an email to **[info@theeta.nl](mailto:info@theeta.nl)** with your resume and/or LinkedIn profile and the reason you want to work at Theeta. Make sure to include “open application” in the subject.
