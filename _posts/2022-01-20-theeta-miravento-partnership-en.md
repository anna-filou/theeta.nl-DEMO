Theeta introduces Cantina Vallebelbo’s Miravento Line of wines to the European market. A delightful selection of high-quality Italian sparkling wines, appropriate for any occasion. The expanding range currently stars:
- **Moscato d’Asti DOCG**, 
- **Moscato Spumante Rosé**, and 
- **Prosecco DOC**.

## A historic legacy

Since 1956, Vallebelbo has been harvesting and vinifying grapes produced by 160 associated producers who own some 500 hectares of beautiful vineyards in the Langhe hills.

Now, in collaboration with Theeta, the new Miravento range is coming to Europe.
